## Fields
<br>• <b>id</b> (Id of track generated by Spotify)
<br><br>• <b>artists</b> (List of artists mentioned)
<br><br>• <b>name</b> (Name of the song)
<br><br>• <b>genres</b> (Genre of the song)
<br><br>• <b>year</b> (Ranges from 1921 to 2020)
<br><br>• <b>duration_ms</b> (Integer typically ranging from 200k to 300k)
<br><br>• <b>mode</b> (0 = Minor, 1 = Major)
<br><br>• <b>explicit</b> (0 = No explicit content, 1 = Explicit content)
<br><br>• <b>key</b> (All keys on octave encoded as values ranging from 0 to 11, starting on C as 0, C# as 1 and so on…)
<br><br>• <b>popularity</b> : The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.Generally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity. Note that the popularity value may lag actual popularity by a few days: the value is not updated in real time.
<br><br>• <b>acousticness</b> : A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
<br><br>• <b>danceability</b> : Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
<br><br>• <b>energy</b> : Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.
<br><br>• <b>instrumentalness</b> : Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal.” The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.
<br><br>• <b>valence</b> : A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
<br><br>• <b>tempo</b> : The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.
<br><br>• <b>liveness</b> : Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.
<br><br>• <b>loudness</b> (Float typically ranging from -60 to 0)
<br><br>• <b>speechiness</b> : Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
